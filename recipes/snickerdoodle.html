        <h2>Soft and Chewy Christmas Cookies</h2>
        <p><em>The popular cinnamon-sugar soft and chewy sugar cookie recipe. A recipe that has been in the family for over 30 years!</em></p>
        <p>This was one of the first cookie recipes I made as a kid.  As I have shared before, I was fully obsessed with cookbooks as a little girl. My Mom collected church cookbooks and I would go straight to the cookie recipes and beg my Mom to let me whip up a batch. I made this snickerdoodle cookie recipe 30 years ago and it is still the best I have ever tasted.</p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Unsalted butter</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Cream of tartar</li>
            <li>Baking soda</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy.  Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Cream for 1-2 minutes longer. </li>
            <li>Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, just until combined.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.  Roll into small balls until round and smooth.</li>
            <li>Drop the dough balls into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered.</li>
            <li>Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes.  Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan.</li>
        </ol>
